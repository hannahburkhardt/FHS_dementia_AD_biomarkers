<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b>: There is a need for fast, accessible, low-cost, and accurate diagnostic methods for early detection of cognitive decline. Dementia diagnoses are usually made years after symptom onset, missing a window of opportunity for early intervention.
<b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To evaluate the use of recorded voice features as proxies for cognitive function by using neuropsychological test measures and existing dementia diagnoses.
<b>METHODS</b>: This study analyzed 170 audio recordings, transcripts, and paired neuropsychological test results from 135 participants selected from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), which includes 97 recordings of cognitively normal participants and 73 recordings of cognitively impaired participants. Acoustic and linguistic features of the voice samples were correlated with cognitive performance measures to verify their association.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Language and voice features, when combined with demographic variables, performed with an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI 0.929-0.983) in predicting cognitive status. Features with good predictive power included the acoustic features mean spectral slope in the 500-1500Hz band, variation in the F2 bandwidth, and variation in the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) 1; the demographic features employment, education, and age; and the text features of number of words, number of compound words, number of unique nouns, and number of proper names.
<b>CONCLUSION</b>: Several linguistic and acoustic biomarkers show correlations and predictive power with regard to neuropsychological testing results and cognitive impairment diagnoses, including dementia. This initial study paves the way for a follow-up comprehensive study incorporating the entire FHS cohort.

        <h2>Neuropsychological parameters</h2>
        <p>
            The FHS administers the following standard neuropsychological tests:
        </p>

        <p><em>Taken from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS):</em></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logical Memory</strong>: Immediate: a short scenario is read. The participant is asked to retell
                the story from memory with as much detail as possible. Delayed: The participant is asked to retell the
                story once more after a delay (e.g. 30 minutes). Recognition: The participant is asked yes/no questions
                about the story. (Maccow, 2011)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Paired Associate Learning</strong>: Immediate: The examiner reads 10 or 14 word pairs to the
                examinee. Then, the examiner reads the first word of each pair, and asks the examinee to provide the
                corresponding word. Delayed: After a delay (e.g. 30 minutes), the participant is again presented with
                the first word of each pair learned in the immediate condition and asked to provide the corresponding
                word. (Maccow, 2011)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visual Reproduction</strong>: Immediate: A series of five designs is shown, one at a time, for
                10 seconds each. After each design is presented, the examinee is asked to draw the design from memory.
                Delayed: After a delay (e.g. 30 minutes), the participant is asked to draw the designs once more.
                Recognition: the examinee is asked to choose which of six designs on a page matches the original design
                shown during the immediate condition.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
<br>
        <p><em>Taken from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS):</em></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Similarities</strong>: Describe how two words or concepts are similar. [Wikipedia]
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information (WAIS-R)</strong>: From the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), R edition.
                General knowledge questions. [Wikipedia]
            </li>

            <li><strong>Block design</strong>: Put together red-and-white blocks in a pattern according to a displayed
                model. This is timed, and some of the more difficult puzzles award bonuses for speed. (Wikipedia)
            </li>

            <li><strong>Digit span (forward and backward)</strong>: Listen to sequences of numbers orally and to repeat
                them as heard and in reverse order. [Wikipedia]
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
<br>
        <p><em>Others:</em></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boston Naming Test (BNT)</strong>: The BNT stimuli are line drawings of objects with increasing
                naming difficulty, ranging from simple, high-frequency vocabulary (tree) to rare words (abacus).
                Administration requires a spontaneous response within a 20-sec period; if such a response is not made,
                two
                kinds of prompting cues (one phonemic, one semantic) may be given. (Spreen, 1998)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Finger tapping test (left and right)</strong>: The finger-tapping test (FTT) is a
                neuropsychological
                test that examines motor functioning, specifically, motor speed and lateralized coordination. During
                administration, the subject's palm should be immobile and flat on the board, with fingers extended, and
                the
                index finder placed on the counting device. One hand at a time, subjects tap their index finger on the
                lever
                as quickly as possible within a 10-s time interval, in order to increase the number on the counting
                device
                with each tap. (Springer Link, 2013)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time to complete Trails</strong>: The Trail Making Test (TMT) has parts A and B. The TMT Part A
                consists of 25 circles on a piece of paper with the numbers 1-25 written randomly in the circles. The
                test
                taker’s task is to start with number one and draw a line from that circle to the circle with the number
                two
                in it to the circle with the three in it, etc. The person continues to connect the circles in numerical
                order until they reach number 25. The TMT Part B consists of 24 circles on a piece of paper, but rather
                than
                all of the circles containing numbers, half of the circles have the numbers 1-12 in them and the other
                half
                (12) contain the letters A-L. The person taking the test has the more difficult task of drawing a line
                from
                one circle to the next in ascending order; however, he must alternate the circles with numbers in them
                (1-13) with circles with letters in them (A-L). In other words, he is to connect the circles in order
                like
                this: 1-A-2-B-3-C-4-D-5-E and so on.
                (Heerema, 2019)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hooper Visual Organization Test</strong>: This test has 30 line drawings, each showing a common
                object such as a ball or a pencil. Each drawing has been cut into several pieces. The pieces are
                scattered
                on the page like parts of a puzzle. The client's task is to tell you what the object is. The VOT has no
                time
                limit. (Mevius, 2019)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Verbal Fluency</strong>: Animals only: Participants have to produce as many animal names as
                possible
                in 1 minute. Exclude animals: Participants have to produce as many words as possible that start with the
                given letter (e.g. F or A) in 1 minute, avoiding proper names.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wide range achievement test (reading)</strong>: Assesses reading for words with irregular
                sound-to-spelling correspondence, for example <em>unanimous</em>.

            variables. The default box selected shows a positive correlation between the acoustic variable 'jitter'
            (deviations in individual consecutive F0 period lengths) and time to complete a neuropsychological task
